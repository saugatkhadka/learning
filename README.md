# Learning Log
This is a running log of things I'm learning to re/build up a stronger software engineering skills a little bit everyday. 

This is aimed towards re-exploring programming language and engineering foundations so I can understand the limits of my knowledge and expand them further. I want to know what I know and what I don't know, and put both of them to use to build this tower of babel.

Inspired by [learning](https://github.com/amitness/learning) repo from amitness.

## Language Proficiency

General language competencies as expected of any fullstack engineer these days. Need Python to work through further resources.

| Resource                                                                                     | Progress | Notes |

Helpful additional materials available for Python in [dabeaz/python-mastery](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/python-mastery).

## Foundation
This part is focused around building up foundational computer science concepts that I've found I often needed in my career.

| Resource                                                                             | Progress | Notes |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ----- |
| [CSPrimer: Programming Beyond the Basics](https://csprimer.com/courses/programming/) | -        |       |
| [CSPrimer: Algorithm and Data Structures](https://csprimer.com/courses/algorithms/)  | -        |       |
| [CSPrimer: Distributed Systems](https://csprimer.com/courses/distributed-systems/)   | -        |       |
| [CSPrimer: Computer Systems](https://csprimer.com/courses/systems/)                  | -        |       |

There are more things to learn there like Computer Networks, Operating Systems and Relational Databases available in [CSPrimer](https://csprimer.com/courses/) which I intend to eventually get to, but these 4 above are the foundation that should cover my bases well for further exploration into ML and for more technical senior software engineering roles.

There are a lot of book recommendations (same as [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)) inside of CSPrimer which should be mandatory reading (do the exercises).

## Mathematics
This includes all the maths I need I learn and master to complete [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.mathacademy.com/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning)  in [MathAcademy](https://www.mathacademy.com/courses/), to have solid foundations for ML and contribute meaningfully towards any serious ML efforts.

Intention is to finish all the Mathematical Foundation courses and then start with Maths for ML alongside University Math Courses as needed.

- More to be added as I expand my list. 
- [amitness/learning](https://github.com/amitness/learning) looks like a good place to skrib off some good resources regarding LLMs and agents, combined with my other obsidian vaults regarding vLLM, TTS/STT, multi modality, agents and long running assistants, which is **the** area I want to heavily explore and invest myself this year.
